## Tasks

### Day 1-3: Timeline Library
- [ ] Choose library (react-big-calendar recommended)
- [ ] Install:
  ```bash
  npm install react-big-calendar date-fns
  ```
- [ ] Create timeline page: `/app/(dashboard)/timeline/page.tsx`
- [ ] Render features as events (horizontal bars)
- [ ] Quarter-based view (Q1, Q2, Q3, Q4 columns)

### Day 4-5: Drag-to-Reschedule
- [ ] Enable drag-and-drop on timeline
- [ ] Update feature dates when dragged
- [ ] Show date picker on click (precise dates)
- [ ] Validate dependencies (warn if violates)

### Day 6-7: Dependency Arrows
- [ ] Render SVG arrows between dependent features
- [ ] Calculate arrow paths (start/end coordinates)
- [ ] Different arrow styles per link type:
  - [ ] Solid for dependencies
  - [ ] Dashed for blocks
- [ ] Hover to highlight path

### Day 8-9: Swimlanes & Filters
- [ ] Group by:
  - [ ] Team (Backend, Frontend, Mobile)
  - [ ] Status (Not Started, In Progress, Done)
  - [ ] Category
  - [ ] Assignee
- [ ] Filter panel (multi-select dropdowns)
- [ ] Zoom levels (month/quarter/year buttons)

### Day 10-12: Work Item Detail Page (8-Tab Structure)

> **📋 Full Design Spec:** See [work-board-3.0.md Part 7](work-board-3.0.md#part-7-work-item-detail-page-8-tab-structure)

- [ ] Work Item detail page: `/app/(dashboard)/workspaces/[id]/work-items/[workItemId]/page.tsx`
- [ ] **8-Tab Structure** (Phase-based progressive disclosure):
  - [ ] **Summary** - Overview, status, timeline, health indicators
  - [ ] **Inspiration** - Research links, competitor analysis, user quotes
  - [ ] **Resources** - Figma, GitHub, docs, API specs
  - [ ] **Scope** - Problem statement, success metrics, constraints
  - [ ] **Tasks** - Universal task module (linked to work items/timelines)
  - [ ] **Feedback** - Quick link to Feedback Module
  - [ ] **Metrics** *(TBD)* - Analytics tab (future)
  - [ ] **AI Copilot** - Context-aware AI assistant
- [ ] **Tracking Sidebar** (right panel):
  - [ ] Phase indicator with color coding
  - [ ] Status, Priority, Health dropdowns
  - [ ] Owner assignment (dropdown, search)
  - [ ] Target/Due dates
  - [ ] Story Points & Time tracking (Hours Est/Actual)
  - [ ] Tags
- [ ] Phase-based tab visibility using `calculateWorkItemPhase()`

### Day 13-14: Real-time Collaboration
- [ ] Supabase Realtime subscriptions
- [ ] Live cursors on timeline (see teammates)
- [ ] Presence indicators (green dot = online)
- [ ] Activity feed component: `components/shared/activity-feed.tsx`
  - [ ] Recent changes log
  - [ ] "Alex edited 'User Auth' 5 min ago"

**Technology:** react-big-calendar or vis-timeline

**Features:**
- **Gantt Chart** - Horizontal bars showing feature duration
- **Quarter-Based View** - Q1, Q2, Q3, Q4 columns (or custom date ranges)
- **Drag-to-Reschedule** - Change dates visually (drag bar left/right)
- **Dependency Arrows** - SVG lines connecting dependent features
- **Swimlanes** - Group by:
  - Team (Backend, Frontend, Mobile)
  - Status (Not Started, In Progress, Done)
  - Category (Feature, Bug, Technical Debt)
  - Assignee (Alex, Sarah, David)
- **Zoom Levels:**
  - Day view (granular)
  - Week view
