## Goal
Structured feature management, visual dependency graph

---

## Tasks

### Day 1-3: Feature Management
- [ ] Dashboard page: `/app/(dashboard)/dashboard/page.tsx`
- [ ] Feature card component: `components/dashboard/feature-card.tsx`
- [ ] Feature list (grid layout)
- [ ] Feature CRUD operations:
  - [ ] Create feature modal
  - [ ] Edit feature (inline or modal)
  - [ ] Delete feature (confirmation)
- [ ] Timeline breakdown (MVP/SHORT/LONG tabs)
- [ ] Difficulty badges (Easy/Medium/Hard)
- [ ] Category tags (multi-select)

### Day 4-5: Rich Text Editor
- [ ] Install Tiptap:
  ```bash
  npm install @tiptap/react @tiptap/starter-kit
  ```
- [ ] Create editor component: `components/shared/rich-text-editor.tsx`
- [ ] Add formatting toolbar (bold, italic, lists, headings)
- [ ] Integrate into feature description field

### Day 6-7: Custom Fields
- [ ] Custom fields system (extensible metadata)
- [ ] Field types: Text, Number, Date, Select, Checkbox
- [ ] Add custom field UI (Settings → Workspace → Custom Fields)
- [ ] Render custom fields in feature detail

### Day 8-10: Dependency Graph
- [ ] Install ReactFlow (if not already)
- [ ] Create dependency graph page: `/app/(dashboard)/dependencies/page.tsx`
- [ ] Render features as nodes
- [ ] Render dependencies as edges
- [ ] 4 link types with different styles:
  - [ ] ➡️ Dependency (solid line)
  - [ ] 🚫 Blocks (red dashed line)
  - [ ] 🤝 Complements (green line)
  - [ ] 📚 Relates to (gray dotted line)
- [ ] Drag to create link (connect nodes)

### Day 11-12: AI Dependencies
- [ ] "Suggest dependencies" tool
- [ ] Analyze feature descriptions (semantic similarity)
- [ ] Propose dependencies (with confidence score)
- [ ] User approves/rejects suggestions
- [ ] Critical path algorithm (longest chain)

### Day 13-14: Dependency Health
- [ ] Health score calculation (risk assessment)
- [ ] Circular dependency detection (warn user)
- [ ] Bottleneck identification (features blocking many)
- [ ] Export dependency graph (PNG, JSON)

## Module Features

### Feature Planning Module 📋

**Purpose:** Structured feature management

**Features:**
- **Feature CRUD** (create, read, update, delete)
- **Timeline Breakdown:**
  - MVP - Must-have features for launch
  - SHORT - Near-term enhancements (3-6 months)
  - LONG - Future vision (6-12+ months)
- **Difficulty Estimation** (Easy / Medium / Hard)
- **Category Tagging** (backend, frontend, mobile, design, etc.)
- **Rich Text Descriptions** (Tiptap editor with formatting)
- **Custom Fields** (extensible metadata for your workflow)
- **Attachments** (files, images, design mockups)

**AI Assistance:**
- "Suggest USP" (unique selling points)
- "Estimate difficulty" (based on description)
- "Improve description" (rewrite for clarity)
- "Break down into phases" (auto-split MVP/SHORT/LONG)
- "Generate user stories" (convert to story format)

### Dependency Management Module 🔗

**Purpose:** Visualize and manage relationships between features

**Technology:** ReactFlow (for interactive graph)

**Features:**

#### Link Types (4 Total):
1. **➡️ Dependency** - Feature A must complete before Feature B can start
2. **🚫 Blocks** - Feature A prevents Feature B from proceeding
3. **🤝 Complements** - Features A and B work well together (synergy)
4. **📚 Relates to** - Informational connection (related but no dependency)

#### Core Functionality:
- **Visual Graph** - Interactive node-edge diagram
- **Bidirectional Links** - Auto-maintain both directions (A→B means B←A)
- **Critical Path Analysis** - Highlight longest dependency chain
- **Dependency Health Score** - Risk assessment (cascading delays)
- **Circular Dependency Detection** - Warn about impossible schedules

#### AI Features:
- **Auto-detect dependencies** from feature descriptions
- **Suggest optimal execution order** (which features to tackle first)
- **Predict bottlenecks** (features that block many others)
- **Calculate risk** (impact of delays)

**UI Location:** Graph view (`/workspace/[id]/dependencies`)

## Deliverables

✅ Feature management system complete
✅ Rich text editor for descriptions
✅ Custom fields system
✅ Visual dependency graph
✅ AI-suggested dependencies
✅ Critical path analysis

---

## Testing

- [ ] Create 10 features with descriptions
- [ ] Add custom fields (e.g., "Business Value")
- [ ] Open dependency graph
- [ ] Manually create 5 dependencies
- [ ] Run "Suggest dependencies" AI tool
- [ ] Verify critical path is highlighted
- [ ] Test circular dependency detection
