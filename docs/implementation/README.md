### Cost Sustainability Analysis

**Scenario: 100 Teams (30% Pro conversion rate)**
- Free teams: 70 × $0 = $0
- Pro teams: 30 teams (avg 8 users) = 30 × $55 = **$1,650/month revenue**

**Monthly Costs:**
- Vercel Pro: $20
- Supabase Pro: $25
- Stripe fees (3%): ~$50
- AI costs (Pro users, avg 500 msgs): ~$150
- Email (Resend): $20

**Profit:** $1,650 - $294 = **$1,356/month** ✅

**Scenario: 1,000 Teams (30% Pro)**
- Revenue: 300 × $55 = **$16,500/month**
- Costs: Vercel $20 + Supabase $599 + Stripe $495 + AI $1,500 + Monitoring $29 = **~$2,643/month**
- **Profit:** $13,857/month 💰💰💰

**Highly sustainable and profitable!**

## 🏗️ PLATFORM ARCHITECTURE

### Workspace = Project Model

```
Organization (Team)
├── Workspace 1: "Mobile Fitness App"
│   ├── Phase: Execution
│   ├── Enabled Modules: [Research, Mind Map, Features, Dependencies, Timeline, Execution, Collaboration]
│   ├── Features: 25
│   └── Team Members: 8
│
├── Workspace 2: "AI Platform Research"
│   ├── Phase: Research
│   ├── Enabled Modules: [Research, Mind Map, AI Assistant]
│   ├── Features: 5 (ideas)
│   └── Team Members: 3
│
└── Workspace 3: "Web Dashboard v2"
    ├── Phase: Review
    ├── Enabled Modules: [Features, Timeline, Review, Analytics]
    ├── Features: 15
    └── Team Members: 5
```

### Lifecycle Phases (Sequential Workflow)

```
Phase 1: Research 🔍
   ↓ (Brainstorm → Structured ideas)
Phase 2: Planning 📋
   ↓ (Convert to features, plan timeline)
Phase 3: Review 👥
   ↓ (Get stakeholder/user feedback)
Phase 4: Execution 🚀
   ↓ (Build the product)
Phase 5: Testing 🧪
   ↓ (Beta test, iterate)
Phase 6: Metrics 📊
   ↓ (Measure success vs goals)
Complete ✅
```

**Each phase auto-enables recommended modules** (can be customized in Settings → Modules).

### Module System Design

**Modules** are feature groups that can be toggled per workspace:
- Reduces UI clutter (hide what you don't need)
- Adapts interface to current lifecycle phase
- Progressive disclosure (complexity when needed)

**Example:**
- During **Research** phase: Enable Mind Map, Research, AI Chat
- During **Execution** phase: Enable Project Execution, Timeline, Collaboration
- During **Metrics** phase: Enable Analytics, Success Tracking
