# Unified Canvas Future Enhancements

**Status**: Phase 1-5 Complete (Production Ready) | Phase 6 Postponed
**Last Updated**: 2025-01-20
**Dependencies**: Core canvas system must be tested and stable

---

## Overview

The unified canvas system is **production-ready** with core functionality complete. Phase 6 enhancements add advanced hierarchical organization features for large-scale projects.

---

## Phase 6: Sub-Flow System (Postponed)

### What Was Postponed

**Hierarchical Work Flows** - Multi-level canvas organization system:
- **Flow Nodes**: Collapsible containers representing sub-canvases
- **Lazy Loading**: Load sub-flow content only when expanded
- **Breadcrumb Navigation**: Visual path showing current flow hierarchy
- **Auto-Detection**: DBSCAN clustering to suggest sub-flow creation

### Why Postponed

1. **Core system needs validation** - Must test current implementation with real users first
2. **Database schema is ready** - `work_flows` table already exists (migration applied)
3. **Complexity vs. value** - Advanced feature that 90% of users won't need initially
4. **Performance impact unknown** - Need baseline metrics from current system

### When to Implement

**Triggers for resuming**:
- ✅ Core canvas tested in production for 2+ weeks
- ✅ Users request hierarchical organization (3+ requests)
- ✅ Performance metrics show system handles 100+ nodes well
- ✅ Clear use case emerges (e.g., enterprise customer with 500+ work items)

**Estimated effort**: 8-12 hours (1.5-2 days)

## Implementation Details (When Ready)

### 6.1 FlowNode Component (2-3 hours)

**Purpose**: Render collapsed sub-flows as special nodes on canvas

**Files to create**:
- `src/components/canvas/nodes/flow-node.tsx` - Collapsible flow container
- `src/components/canvas/flow-breadcrumbs.tsx` - Navigation path

**Features**:
- Click to expand/collapse sub-flow
- Show child count and depth indicator
- Visual differentiation from regular work items
- Lazy load sub-flow content on expand

**Example UI**:
```
┌─────────────────────────────┐
│ 📦 Authentication System    │
│ ────────────────────────── │
│ 12 items • 3 levels deep    │
│ [Expand ▼]                  │
└─────────────────────────────┘
```

### 6.2 Breadcrumb Navigation (1-2 hours)

**Purpose**: Show current position in flow hierarchy

**Location**: Top of canvas (Panel position="top-center")

**Features**:
- Click any breadcrumb to navigate to that level
- Show flow names with depth indicators
- Highlight current flow
- Collapse long paths (Root > ... > Current)

**Example**:
```
Home > Workspace > Authentication > OAuth2 Implementation
```

### 6.3 Auto-Detection Algorithm (3-4 hours)

**Purpose**: Suggest sub-flow creation based on node clustering

**Algorithm**: DBSCAN (Density-Based Spatial Clustering)

**Triggers**:
- Canvas has 50+ nodes
- Detected cluster has 10+ tightly connected nodes
- Cluster has clear boundary (few external connections)

**Implementation**:
```typescript
// Pseudo-code
function detectSubFlowCandidates(nodes: Node[], edges: Edge[]) {
  // 1. Calculate spatial density
  // 2. Find dense clusters (DBSCAN with eps=150, minPts=10)
  // 3. Check cluster connectivity
  // 4. Suggest sub-flow for clusters with <20% external edges
}
```

**UI**: Show suggestion banner:
```
💡 Suggestion: Group 15 related authentication items into a sub-flow?
[Create Sub-Flow] [Dismiss]
```

### 6.4 Lazy Loading System (2-3 hours)

**Purpose**: Load sub-flow nodes only when needed

**Strategy**:
1. **Initial load**: Load only root-level nodes
2. **On expand**: Fetch sub-flow nodes via API
3. **On collapse**: Keep nodes in memory (cache) but hide from canvas
4. **Cache invalidation**: Refresh on sub-flow updates

**API Route**:
```typescript
// GET /api/flows/[flowId]/nodes
// Returns: { nodes: WorkItem[], edges: LinkedItem[] }
```

**State management**:
```typescript
const [flowCache, setFlowCache] = useState<Map<string, { nodes, edges }>>()
```

## Database Schema (Already Complete)

The `work_flows` table was created in the initial migration:

```sql
CREATE TABLE work_flows (
  id TEXT PRIMARY KEY,
  workspace_id TEXT NOT NULL REFERENCES workspaces(id),
  team_id TEXT NOT NULL REFERENCES teams(id),
  parent_flow_id TEXT REFERENCES work_flows(id),  -- Hierarchical nesting
  name TEXT NOT NULL,
  description TEXT,
  color TEXT DEFAULT '#6366f1',
  is_collapsed BOOLEAN DEFAULT true,
  canvas_position JSONB,  -- Position of FlowNode on parent canvas
  viewport JSONB,         -- Zoom/pan state when viewing this flow
  depth INTEGER DEFAULT 0,
  child_count INTEGER DEFAULT 0,      -- Auto-updated trigger
  work_item_count INTEGER DEFAULT 0,  -- Auto-updated trigger
  created_at TIMESTAMPTZ DEFAULT NOW(),
  updated_at TIMESTAMPTZ DEFAULT NOW()
);
```

**Key fields**:
- `parent_flow_id`: Links to parent flow (NULL = root)
- `depth`: Hierarchy level (0 = root, 1 = sub-flow, etc.)
- `canvas_position`: Where FlowNode appears on parent canvas
- `viewport`: Remembers zoom/pan when re-opening flow

## Testing Checklist (Before Implementation)

**Performance Validation**:
- [ ] Current system handles 100+ nodes at 60 FPS
- [ ] Layout computation completes in <500ms for 100 nodes
- [ ] No memory leaks after 10 minutes of use
- [ ] Performance monitor shows stable metrics

**User Validation**:
- [ ] Users successfully create 50+ work items
- [ ] Users request grouping/organization features
- [ ] Users understand relationship filtering
- [ ] No major bugs in core canvas system

**Technical Readiness**:
- [ ] Database migration stable (no rollbacks needed)
- [ ] Real-time updates working reliably
- [ ] AI note conversion tested with 10+ examples
- [ ] Performance thresholds calibrated for user hardware

## Success Metrics (After Implementation)

**Performance**:
- Sub-flow expansion completes in <200ms
- No FPS drop when loading sub-flows
- Cache hit rate >80% for frequently accessed flows

**Usage**:
- 30% of users create at least one sub-flow
- Average sub-flow has 15-25 items
- Sub-flow navigation used 5+ times per session

**Quality**:
- Auto-detection suggests valid groupings 70%+ of time
- Users accept auto-detection suggestions 40%+ of time
- Zero data loss during flow operations

## Alternative Approaches (Considered)

### Approach 1: Tags Instead of Sub-Flows
**Pros**: Simpler, no hierarchy
**Cons**: Doesn't reduce visual complexity
**Decision**: Rejected - doesn't solve large canvas problem

### Approach 2: Multiple Canvases (Separate Workspaces)
**Pros**: No new code needed
**Cons**: Loses cross-flow relationships
**Decision**: Rejected - breaks unified view benefit

### Approach 3: Virtual Folders (Filter-Based)
**Pros**: Flexible, no nesting
**Cons**: Manual organization, no spatial grouping
**Decision**: Rejected - doesn't leverage canvas strengths

## Review Notes

**Next Review Date**: After 2 weeks of production use (Est. 2025-02-03)

**Questions to Answer**:
1. Do users actually need hierarchical organization?
2. What canvas size triggers the need for sub-flows?
3. Are there simpler alternatives to DBSCAN clustering?
4. Should sub-flows be a Pro-tier feature?

**Decision Maker**: Product team + User feedback
