## 📋 WHAT ARE POSTPONED FEATURES?

Features that were planned but **strategically deferred** to later phases due to:
- Dependencies on modules not yet built
- Risk of rework when dependencies change
- Better timing after platform stabilizes
- Resource allocation priorities

**Important:** Postponed ≠ Canceled. These features will be implemented when dependencies are ready.

## 📊 POSTPONEMENT DECISION FRAMEWORK

### 5-Question Framework (Before Implementation)

1. **Data Dependencies:** Does this feature depend on data from other modules?
2. **Integration Points:** Will this integrate with other modules' APIs?
3. **User Experience Flow:** Does this make sense at this point in user journey?
4. **Database Schema Stability:** Does this depend on specific tables/columns?
5. **Testing Feasibility:** Can this be fully tested with currently available data?

**If ANY question reveals blocking dependencies → POSTPONE**

**See:** [CLAUDE.md - Execution Timing](../../CLAUDE.md#execution-timing--dependency-cross-checks)
