1. **Supabase MCP** - Database management, migrations, real-time
2. **Playwright MCP** - E2E testing and browser automation
3. **Parallel Search MCP** - Multi-source web search for AI research
4. **Parallel Task MCP** - Task orchestration and automation
5. **Vercel MCP** - Deployment management and monitoring

## Supabase MCP (Essential)

### When to Use

- Creating database migrations (`CREATE TABLE`, `ALTER TABLE`, RLS policies)
- Running complex queries (joins, aggregations, transactions)
- Setting up real-time subscriptions
- Generating TypeScript types from schema
- Optimizing queries and indexes
- Creating PostgreSQL functions and triggers

### Example Prompts

**Database Migrations**:
```
"Create migration for mind_maps table with team_id and RLS policies"
"Add indexes to features table for team_id and workspace_id"
"Create RLS policies for team-based access to workspaces table"
```

**Real-time Subscriptions**:
```
"Set up Supabase Realtime subscriptions for workspace changes"
"Create real-time listener for features table filtered by team_id"
```

**TypeScript Generation**:
```
"Generate TypeScript types from current schema"
"Update TypeScript types after adding mind_maps table"
```

**Query Optimization**:
```
"Optimize the query for loading features with timeline_items"
"Add composite index for (team_id, workspace_id, created_at)"
"Analyze slow query for dashboard analytics"
```

### Advanced Usage

**Complex Migration with Functions**:
```
"Create migration that:
1. Adds 'status' column to features table
2. Creates trigger to update updated_at timestamp
3. Adds CHECK constraint for status enum values
4. Updates RLS policies to include status filtering"
```

**Performance Analysis**:
```
"Analyze the performance of queries in the features module"
"Suggest indexes for improving dashboard load times"
"Identify N+1 query issues in the current schema"
```

## MCP Best Practices

### 1. When to Use MCPs vs. Direct Commands

**Use MCP when**:
- ✅ Complex operations requiring context (migrations, complex queries)
- ✅ Multi-step workflows (test creation, deployment pipelines)
- ✅ Operations requiring domain expertise (search strategies, test patterns)
- ✅ Integration with external services (Supabase, Vercel, search engines)

**Use direct commands when**:
- ✅ Simple file operations (read, write, edit)
- ✅ Basic git commands (status, commit, push)
- ✅ Simple npm commands (install, run dev)

### 2. Combining MCPs

MCPs can work together for complex workflows:

```
"Using Supabase MCP: Create migration for new analytics table
Then using Parallel Task MCP: Generate TypeScript types and update API routes in parallel
Finally using Playwright MCP: Create E2E tests for analytics dashboard"
```

### 3. Error Handling

When MCP operations fail:

1. **Read error messages carefully** - MCPs provide detailed context
2. **Check prerequisites** - Ensure dependencies exist (tables, APIs, etc.)
3. **Verify permissions** - RLS policies, API keys, environment variables
4. **Try incremental approach** - Break complex operations into steps

### 4. Context Optimization

To reduce token usage:

- ✅ Be specific in prompts (table names, exact operations)
- ✅ Reference existing patterns ("Create migration similar to mind_maps")
- ✅ Use docs cross-references ("Follow pattern in CODE_PATTERNS.md")
- ❌ Don't repeat full context every time

## Troubleshooting

### Supabase MCP Issues

**Problem**: Migration fails with RLS error
**Solution**: Check team_members table exists and has correct structure

**Problem**: TypeScript types not updating
**Solution**: Run `npx supabase gen types typescript --local > lib/supabase/types.ts`

### Playwright MCP Issues

**Problem**: Tests fail in CI but pass locally
**Solution**: Check for timing issues, add explicit waits

**Problem**: Element not found
**Solution**: Use `data-testid` attributes, avoid brittle selectors

### Parallel Search MCP Issues

**Problem**: Search returns no results
**Solution**: Refine query, try different search engines

**Problem**: Rate limiting
**Solution**: Space out requests, use caching

### Vercel MCP Issues

**Problem**: Build fails
**Solution**: Check environment variables, build logs

**Problem**: Deployment stuck
**Solution**: Check Vercel dashboard, may need to cancel and redeploy
