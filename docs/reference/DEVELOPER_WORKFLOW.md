## Introduction

### Why This Workflow Matters (Even for Solo Developers)

**Common Misconception**: "I'm working alone, so I don't need branches, PRs, or code review."

**Reality**: Professional workflows prevent bugs, enable safe experimentation, and provide rollback points. Even solo developers benefit from:

| Benefit | How It Helps |
|---------|--------------|
| **Self-Review** | Catches 80% of bugs before production |
| **Rollback Points** | Easy to undo changes if something breaks |
| **Experimentation** | Try ideas on branches without breaking main |
| **Clear History** | Know exactly what changed and when |
| **Professional Habits** | Builds skills for team collaboration |

**Real-World Impact**:
- **Time Saved**: 10-25 min overhead per feature, saves 2-4 hours debugging production issues
- **Bugs Prevented**: Self-review catches type errors, missing edge cases, broken links
- **Confidence**: Main branch always works, deployments are stress-free

---

## The 8-Step Workflow

### Overview: Idea → Deployed Feature

**Golden Rule**: Main branch is ALWAYS production-ready. Never commit directly to main.

### Quick Reference Table

| Step | Command | Time | Critical? |
|------|---------|------|-----------|
| 1. Start fresh | `git checkout main && git pull` | 10s | ✅ |
| 2. Create branch | `git checkout -b feat/name` | 5s | ✅ |
| 3. Develop | Code → `git add` → `git commit -m "feat: ..."` | 30-180min | - |
| 4. Push | `git push -u origin feat/name` | 10s | ✅ |
| 5. Create PR | `gh pr create --title "..." --body "..."` | 3-5min | ✅ |
| 6. Self-review | Review diff on GitHub, fix issues | 5-15min | 🚨 CRITICAL |
| 7. Merge | `gh pr merge --squash` | 30s | ✅ |
| 8. Verify | Test on production | 2-5min | ✅ |

**Total Overhead**: ~10-25 minutes beyond development time
**Bugs Prevented**: ~80% caught before production (via self-review)

---

## Detailed Step-by-Step Guide

### Step 1: Start Fresh (Pull Latest Main)

**Purpose**: Ensure you're building on the latest stable code.

**Commands**:
```bash
# Switch to main branch
git checkout main

# Pull latest changes from remote
git pull origin main
```

**Why It Matters**:
- Prevents merge conflicts later
- Ensures you're not working on outdated code
- Synchronizes with any deployments made since last pull

**Common Mistake**: Forgetting this step and creating branch from stale main
**Fix**: If you realize later, rebase your branch: `git rebase main`

---

### Step 2: Create Feature Branch

**Purpose**: Isolate your changes from production code.

**Commands**:
```bash
# Create and switch to new branch
git checkout -b feat/new-feature-name
```

**Branch Naming Conventions**:

| Type | Format | Example |
|------|--------|---------|
| **Feature** | `feat/description` | `feat/work-item-review-system` |
| **Bug fix** | `fix/description` | `fix/timeline-calculation-loop` |
| **Docs** | `docs/description` | `docs/update-api-reference` |
| **Refactor** | `refactor/description` | `refactor/auth-service` |
| **Test** | `test/description` | `test/e2e-workspace-crud` |

**Best Practices**:
- ✅ Use descriptive names (not `feat/update` or `fix/bug`)
- ✅ Keep names under 50 characters
- ✅ Use kebab-case (hyphens, not underscores)
- ❌ Don't include issue numbers in branch name (put in PR description)

**Why It Matters**:
- Main branch stays stable while you experiment
- Easy to see what each branch does
- Can work on multiple features in parallel (using git worktrees)

---

### Step 3: Develop (Code, Commit, Iterate)

**Purpose**: Implement your feature with atomic commits.

**Commands**:
```bash
# Make changes to files
# ... edit code ...

# Check what changed
git status

# Stage changes
git add .

# Commit with descriptive message
git commit -m "feat: add user profile settings page"

# Continue iterating
# ... more changes ...
git add .
git commit -m "feat: add validation to profile form"
```

**Commit Message Format**:

```
<type>: <short description (50 chars max)>

[Optional body explaining WHY this change was made]
```

**Types**:
- `feat`: New feature
- `fix`: Bug fix
- `docs`: Documentation
- `refactor`: Code refactoring (no functional change)
- `test`: Adding tests
- `chore`: Maintenance (dependency updates, config)

**Good Examples**:
```
feat: add dark mode toggle to user settings
fix: resolve infinite loop in timeline calculation
docs: update API reference for work items endpoint
refactor: extract auth logic to separate service
test: add E2E tests for workspace CRUD
chore: update shadcn/ui components to v2.0
```

**Bad Examples** (Don't Do This):
```
Update files  (too vague)
fix bug  (not descriptive)
changes  (meaningless)
WIP  (work in progress - commit when done!)
asdf  (definitely no!)
```

**Atomic Commits Best Practice**:
- Each commit = one logical change
- Commit often (every 30-60 min of work)
- Makes it easy to revert specific changes
- Creates clear history

**Why It Matters**:
- Clear commit history helps you understand what changed
- Easy to revert bad commits
- Makes code review easier
- Professional habit for team work

---

### Step 4: Push to Remote Branch

**Purpose**: Backup your work and prepare for PR creation.

**Commands**:
```bash
# First push (creates remote branch)
git push -u origin feat/new-feature-name

# Subsequent pushes (after more commits)
git push
```

**The `-u` Flag**:
- Sets upstream tracking
- Only needed on first push
- After that, just `git push` works

**Why It Matters**:
- Backs up your work to GitHub (not just local)
- Required before creating pull request
- Enables collaboration (others can see your branch)

---

### Step 5: Create Pull Request

**Purpose**: Document your changes and prepare for review.

**Commands**:
```bash
# Using GitHub CLI (recommended)
gh pr create --title "Add user profile settings" --body "See PR description"

# Alternative: Use GitHub web interface
# Navigate to: https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/YOUR_REPO/pulls
# Click "New Pull Request"
```

**PR Title Best Practices**:
- ✅ Descriptive and clear: "Add user profile settings page"
- ✅ Matches commit message format: "feat: add user profile settings"
- ❌ Vague: "Update code" or "Fix issue"

**PR Description** (see template in next section for details):
- Summary of what changed
- Why you made this change
- What testing was done
- Screenshots for UI changes
- Related issues or tickets

**Why It Matters**:
- Creates permanent record of what changed
- Enables self-review process (next step)
- Documents decisions for future reference
- Shows GitHub diff for easy review

---

### Step 6: Self-Review (CRITICAL STEP)

**Purpose**: Catch bugs, typos, and logic errors BEFORE merging to production.

**How to Do It**:

1. **Open PR on GitHub** → Click "Files changed" tab
2. **Read through EVERY line** of the diff
3. **Check for issues** using checklist below
4. **Leave comments** on lines that need fixes
5. **Make fixes locally**, commit, and push
6. **Re-review** until no issues remain

**Self-Review Checklist** (covered in detail below):
- [ ] Code quality (no console.logs, proper error handling)
- [ ] Security (no hardcoded secrets, proper auth checks)
- [ ] Testing (edge cases covered, errors handled)
- [ ] Documentation (comments added, docs updated)
- [ ] Performance (no unnecessary re-renders, efficient queries)
- [ ] User experience (error messages clear, loading states present)

**Why This Step Is CRITICAL**:

| Without Self-Review | With Self-Review |
|-------------------|------------------|
| 80% of bugs ship to production | 80% of bugs caught before merge |
| Debug issues in production (stressful) | Fix issues locally (calm) |
| Risk of breaking main branch | Main branch stays stable |
| No learning from mistakes | Learn by reviewing own code |

**Real Example**:
```
❌ Without review: Merge immediately → Production breaks → 2 hours debugging

✅ With review: Spot missing null check in 5 minutes → Add fix → Merge safely
```

**Time Investment**: 5-15 minutes
**Bugs Prevented**: 80% (industry data)

---

### Step 7: Merge to Main

**Purpose**: Integrate your feature into the production codebase.

**Commands**:
```bash
# Using GitHub CLI (squash merge recommended)
gh pr merge --squash

# Alternative: Use GitHub web interface
# Click "Squash and merge" button
```

**Merge Strategies**:

| Strategy | When to Use | Pros | Cons |
|----------|-------------|------|------|
| **Squash and Merge** | Solo projects, feature branches | Clean history, one commit per feature | Loses individual commit history |
| **Merge Commit** | Team projects, long-lived branches | Preserves full history | Cluttered main branch |
| **Rebase and Merge** | Linear history preference | Clean, linear history | Rewrites commit history |

**Recommendation for Solo Developers**: Use **Squash and Merge**
- Main branch shows one commit per feature
- Easy to understand history
- Easy to revert entire features

**After Merge**:
```bash
# Switch back to main
git checkout main

# Pull the merge commit
git pull origin main

# Delete local feature branch (cleanup)
git branch -d feat/new-feature-name

# Delete remote branch (optional - GitHub can auto-delete)
git push origin --delete feat/new-feature-name
```

**Why It Matters**:
- Keeps main branch clean and organized
- Makes it easy to see what changed in production
- Provides clear rollback points if needed

---

### Step 8: Verify on Production

**Purpose**: Ensure your changes work correctly in production environment.

**Steps**:

1. **Wait for deployment** (Vercel auto-deploys main branch)
2. **Visit production URL**: https://platform-test-cyan.vercel.app
3. **Test the feature** you just deployed
4. **Check for errors** in browser console
5. **Verify edge cases** work as expected

**Production Checklist**:
- [ ] Feature visible and functional
- [ ] No console errors
- [ ] Mobile responsive (test on phone)
- [ ] Loading states work
- [ ] Error handling works (test invalid inputs)

**If Issues Found**:
1. Create new branch: `fix/production-issue`
2. Fix the issue
3. Follow steps 3-8 again (quick hotfix)

**Why It Matters**:
- Catches environment-specific issues
- Ensures deployment succeeded
- Verifies feature works for real users
- Builds confidence in deployment process

## Enforcing the Workflow

Even solo developers benefit from enforced workflows to prevent accidentally breaking main.

### Option A: Branch Protection (Recommended for Solo)

**Setup Time**: 5 minutes
**Strictness**: Medium (can bypass for emergencies)
**Best For**: Solo developers who want reminders but need flexibility

**Steps**:

1. Go to GitHub → Your Repository → Settings → Branches
2. Click "Add rule" under Branch protection rules
3. Branch name pattern: `main`
4. Enable these settings:
   - ☑ **Require a pull request before merging**
   - ☑ **Require approvals**: 0 (allows self-merge)
   - ☑ **Allow specified actors to bypass**: [Your username]
5. Click "Create"

**What This Does**:
- ✅ Forces you to create PRs (can't push directly to main)
- ✅ Enables self-review workflow
- ✅ Allows you to bypass for urgent hotfixes
- ✅ No blocked deployments (0 approvals required)

**When to Bypass**:
- Critical production bug that needs immediate fix
- Urgent security patch
- Configuration change that doesn't need review

---

### Option B: Pre-Push Hook (Strict)

**Setup Time**: 10 minutes
**Strictness**: High (completely blocks direct pushes)
**Best For**: Solo developers who want strict enforcement

**Steps**:

1. **Install Husky** (git hook manager):
```bash
cd next-app
npm install --save-dev husky
```

2. **Initialize Husky**:
```bash
npx husky install
```

3. **Create pre-push hook**:
```bash
npx husky add .husky/pre-push
```

4. **Edit `.husky/pre-push` file**:
```bash
#!/bin/sh
. "$(dirname "$0")/_/husky.sh"

# Get current branch name
branch=$(git branch --show-current)

# Block push to main
if [ "$branch" = "main" ]; then
  echo "🚫 Direct push to main blocked!"
  echo ""
  echo "Create a feature branch instead:"
  echo "  git checkout -b feat/your-feature"
  echo ""
  echo "Or if you REALLY need to push to main:"
  echo "  git push --no-verify"
  exit 1
fi

echo "✅ Pushing to branch: $branch"
```

5. **Make hook executable**:
```bash
chmod +x .husky/pre-push
```

6. **Commit the hook**:
```bash
git add .husky/pre-push
git commit -m "chore: add pre-push hook to block main"
git push
```

**What This Does**:
- 🚫 **Completely blocks** direct pushes to main
- ✅ Forces you to use feature branches
- ✅ Provides helpful error message with instructions
- ⚠️ Can bypass with `git push --no-verify` (for emergencies)

**Testing the Hook**:
```bash
# Should be blocked
git checkout main
git push origin main
# Output: "🚫 Direct push to main blocked!"

# Should work
git checkout -b feat/test
git push origin feat/test
# Output: "✅ Pushing to branch: feat/test"
```

### Comparison: Branch Protection vs Pre-Push Hook

| Aspect | Branch Protection | Pre-Push Hook |
|--------|------------------|---------------|
| **Enforcement** | GitHub-side | Local machine |
| **Strictness** | Medium (can bypass) | High (blocks locally) |
| **Setup** | 5 min (web interface) | 10 min (npm install) |
| **Works offline** | No | Yes |
| **Bypassing** | Easy (checkbox) | Requires `--no-verify` |
| **Best for** | Solo devs wanting reminders | Solo devs wanting strict rules |

**Recommendation**: Start with **Branch Protection** (Option A). If you find yourself bypassing too often, stick with it. If you want stricter enforcement, add **Pre-Push Hook** (Option B) as well.

---

## Integration with Phase Commands

The phase-specific commands automate parts of this workflow while preserving critical manual review steps:

### How Phase Commands Map to Workflow Steps

| Workflow Step | Phase Command | What It Does |
|---------------|---------------|--------------|
| Step 1: Start fresh | `/status-check` | Reads current progress, selects next task |
| Step 2: Create branch | `/research-plan` | **Creates feature branch automatically** |
| Step 3: Develop | `/parallel-dev` | Implements with parallel agents, commits changes |
| Step 4-5: Push + Create PR | `/deploy` | **Pushes to remote + Creates PR (STOPS HERE)** |
| Step 6: Self-review | **(Manual)** | **Review PR on GitHub - CRITICAL!** |
| Step 7: Merge | `/merge` | **Squash-merges PR after your approval** |
| Step 8: Verify | (Manual) | Test on production URL |

**IMPORTANT**: `/deploy` does NOT auto-merge! It creates the PR and waits for you to manually review (Step 6) before you run `/merge`.

### Example: Using Phase Commands

```
You: /research-plan

Claude:
✅ Research & Planning Complete

**Branch Created**: feat/enable-e2e-cicd  ← Step 2 automated!

Plan:
1. Add Supabase secrets to GitHub
2. Edit .github/workflows/playwright.yml
3. Test with manual trigger

✅ Run `/parallel-dev` to implement.

---

You: /parallel-dev

Claude:
✅ Development Complete

Changes:
- Edited .github/workflows/playwright.yml
- Enabled automatic PR triggers

Committed: "ci: enable automated E2E tests on push/PR"  ← Step 3 automated!

✅ Run `/quality-review` to verify.

---

You: /deploy

Claude:
✅ PR Created Successfully

PR URL: https://github.com/.../pull/49  ← Steps 4-5 automated!

🛑 NEXT STEP: Manual Self-Review Required (Step 6)

Go to the PR URL and:
1. Review the full diff carefully
2. Check all automated test results
3. Verify merge criteria checklist
4. Look for bugs, security issues, debug code

When self-review complete, run: /merge

---

You: (Reviews PR on GitHub for 10 minutes, finds and fixes a typo)

You: /merge

Claude:
🔍 Validating merge criteria...
✅ All tests passing
✅ Self-review completed
✅ No merge conflicts
✅ Branch up-to-date with main

🔄 Squash-merging PR #49...
✅ PR merged: feat: enable automated E2E tests on push/PR
✅ Branch deleted: feat/enable-e2e-cicd
✅ Switched to main
✅ Pulled latest changes

📝 New commit on main:
   a1b2c3d - ci: enable automated E2E tests on push/PR (#49)

Next step: Verify on production (Step 8)
```

### What Stays Manual vs Automated

| Step | Manual or Automated? | Why |
|------|---------------------|-----|
| 1. Start fresh | Automated (`/status-check`) | Safe to automate |
| 2. Create branch | Automated (`/research-plan`) | Safe to automate |
| 3. Develop | Automated (`/parallel-dev`) | Claude writes code |
| 4-5. Push + Create PR | Automated (`/deploy`) | Safe to automate |
| 6. Self-review | **MANUAL - REQUIRED** | **Critical step - catches 80% of bugs!** |
| 7. Merge | Automated (`/merge`) | Only after you approve in Step 6 |
| 8. Verify | **Manual** | You need to test live site |

**Key Insight**: Phase commands handle the tedious parts (branch creation, commits, PR creation) but **YOU still do the critical thinking** (self-review is MANDATORY before `/merge` command will work).

**The Workflow Flow**:
1. `/research-plan` → Creates branch (Step 2)
2. `/parallel-dev` → Implements code (Step 3)
3. `/deploy` → **Creates PR and STOPS** (Steps 4-5)
4. **YOU manually review** on GitHub (Step 6) ← This is where bugs are caught!
5. `/merge` → Only works if Step 6 complete (Step 7)
6. **YOU manually verify** on production (Step 8)

## Common Mistakes & Fixes

| Mistake | Symptom | Fix |
|---------|---------|-----|
| **Forgot to pull main** | Merge conflicts when pushing | `git checkout main && git pull && git rebase main` |
| **Committed to main directly** | Can't push (if hook enabled) | `git checkout -b feat/temp && git push` |
| **Made typo in commit message** | Embarrassing history | `git commit --amend -m "fixed message"` (before push) |
| **Need to undo last commit** | Wrong files committed | `git reset HEAD~1` (keeps changes) or `git reset --hard HEAD~1` (deletes changes) |
| **Branch out of date with main** | Merge conflicts in PR | `git checkout feat/branch && git rebase main` |
| **Pushed secrets to GitHub** | Security vulnerability | 1. Rotate secrets immediately<br>2. Add to .gitignore<br>3. Force push with secrets removed |
| **PR too large to review** | 500+ line diff | Create multiple smaller PRs - one feature at a time |
| **Forgot to create branch** | Working on main | `git checkout -b feat/temp` (moves commits to new branch) |
| **Want to delete branch** | Too many branches | `git branch -d branch-name` (local) or `git push origin --delete branch-name` (remote) |

### Git Worktrees for Parallel Development

**Problem**: You're working on `feat/feature-a` but need to quickly fix a bug on main without losing your progress.

**Solution**: Git worktrees let you check out multiple branches simultaneously in different directories.

**Setup**:

```bash
# Your main project directory
cd ~/projects/platform-test

# Create worktree for bug fix
git worktree add ../platform-test-bugfix fix/urgent-bug

# Now you have TWO directories:
# 1. ~/projects/platform-test (feat/feature-a branch)
# 2. ~/projects/platform-test-bugfix (fix/urgent-bug branch)

# Work in bug fix directory
cd ../platform-test-bugfix
# ... make fixes ...
git add . && git commit -m "fix: urgent bug"
git push -u origin fix/urgent-bug

# Create PR and merge
gh pr create --title "Fix urgent bug" --body "..."
gh pr merge --squash

# Go back to feature work
cd ~/projects/platform-test
# Continue working on feat/feature-a

# Cleanup when done
git worktree remove ../platform-test-bugfix
```

**Benefits**:
- ✅ No context switching (keep both branches open)
- ✅ No stashing or committing half-done work
- ✅ Work on multiple features in parallel
- ✅ Different dev servers for each worktree

**When to Use**:
- Urgent hotfixes while working on features
- Reviewing someone else's PR locally
- Working on multiple features simultaneously
- Testing changes without affecting main branch

## Summary

### Key Takeaways

1. **Main branch is always production-ready** - Never commit directly to main
2. **Self-review catches 80% of bugs** - Always review your own PRs
3. **Atomic commits create clear history** - One commit = one logical change
4. **Branch names should be descriptive** - `feat/add-user-profile` not `feat/update`
5. **Squash and merge keeps main clean** - One commit per feature
6. **10-25 min overhead saves 2-4 hours debugging** - Workflow pays for itself

### The Professional Developer Mindset

**Beginner Thinking**: "I just want to write code and ship it fast!"

**Professional Thinking**: "I want to write code that works, ship it safely, and sleep well at night."

The workflow overhead (10-25 minutes) is an investment that prevents:
- 🚫 Production bugs that take hours to debug
- 🚫 Breaking changes that affect users
- 🚫 Losing work due to bad commits
- 🚫 Unclear history that makes debugging impossible

**Embrace the workflow. It makes you a better developer.**
