## Decision Lifecycle

```mermaid
graph LR
    A[PROPOSED] --> B[ACCEPTED]
    B --> C[IMPLEMENTED]
    C --> D[EVALUATED]
    D --> E{Valid?}
    E -->|Yes| F[VALIDATED]
    E -->|No| G[SUPERSEDED]
    G -.Triggers.-> A
```

### Status Definitions
- **PROPOSED**: Under discussion, alternatives being evaluated
- **ACCEPTED**: Approved for implementation
- **IMPLEMENTED**: Decision has been coded/deployed
- **EVALUATED**: Post-implementation assessment complete
- **VALIDATED**: Confirmed as correct choice
- **SUPERSEDED**: Replaced by new decision (with audit trail)

## How to Use This Research

### For Implementation
**Before coding any feature:**
1. Check relevant research file for proven patterns
2. Reference statistics when justifying choices
3. Follow recommended UX patterns (validation, disclosure, etc.)
4. Link to research in PR/commit message

**Example**: Implementing role switcher → Read [progressive-disclosure-ux.md](core-research/progressive-disclosure-ux.md)

### For Decision Review
**When questioning an existing decision:**
1. Find decision in [DECISION_INDEX.md](DECISION_INDEX.md)
2. Read linked document for full context + alternatives considered
3. Check "Review Triggers" section
4. If triggered, gather new data and propose update

**Example**: "Why no Slack integration?" → See [scope-decisions.md](architecture-decisions/scope-decisions.md) ADR-002

### For Adding New Decisions
**When making a new architectural or UX decision:**
1. Create research document with findings (use template below)
2. Add entry to [DECISION_INDEX.md](DECISION_INDEX.md)
3. Cross-link from this README
4. Set clear review triggers (time-based or metric-based)

**Template**: See "Decision Records Format" below

### For Challenging Assumptions
**If you think a decision is wrong:**
1. Read the original research + rationale
2. Identify what changed (new data, tech, user feedback)
3. Propose alternative with supporting research
4. Update decision status to PROPOSED → discuss → SUPERSEDED

**Remember**: Decisions have context. Don't just reject—understand first.

## Decision Records Format

All architectural and UX decisions are documented as **ADRs (Architectural Decision Records)** with this structure:

### Required Sections
| Section | Purpose | Example |
|---------|---------|---------|
| **Context** | What situation prompted this decision? | "Users confused by unified task list mixing team types" |
| **Decision** | What did we decide? | "Implement department filtering with icon badges" |
| **Rationale** | Why this choice over alternatives? | "Linear's approach proven at scale, 75% teams need structure" |
| **Alternatives Considered** | What options were evaluated? | "1. Unified list 2. Separate workspaces 3. Department filter (chosen)" |
| **Consequences** | Positive, negative, and risks | "+: Reduces clutter -: Adds config step Risks: Over-categorization" |
| **Review Triggers** | When should we reconsider? | "If >30% users disable departments OR competitor launches better solution" |

### Optional Sections
- **Implementation Notes**: How to code this decision
- **Metrics to Track**: KPIs that validate/invalidate decision
- **Related Decisions**: Cross-links to dependent ADRs
