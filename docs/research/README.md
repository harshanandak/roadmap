## Decision Records Format

All architectural and UX decisions are documented as ADRs (Architectural Decision Records) with this structure:

| Section | Purpose |
|---------|---------|
| **Context** | What situation prompted this decision? |
| **Decision** | What did we decide? |
| **Rationale** | Why this choice over alternatives? |
| **Alternatives Considered** | What options were evaluated? |
| **Consequences** | Positive, negative, and risks |
| **Review Triggers** | When should we reconsider? |

### Decision Lifecycle

```
PROPOSED → ACCEPTED → EVALUATED → VALIDATED or SUPERSEDED
```

- **Proposed**: Under discussion
- **Accepted**: Approved for implementation
- **Evaluated**: Assessed after implementation
- **Validated**: Confirmed as correct
- **Superseded**: Replaced by new decision
