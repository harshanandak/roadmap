## 🎯 WHY 12 WEEKS?

### Velocity Analysis

**Original 8-Week Plan**:
- Total Tasks: 131
- Required Velocity: ~16 tasks/week
- Reality: Only ~14 tasks/week achieved

## 🎯 MAJOR CHANGES FROM ORIGINAL PLAN

### Adjustments

| Original Week | New Week | Module | Reason |
|---------------|----------|--------|--------|
| Week 3 | Week 3-5 | Mind Mapping | Underestimated complexity, AI integration |
| Week 4 | Week 4-5 | Dependencies | Feature dashboard, visualization work |
| Week 7 | Week 6 | AI Integration | **Fast-tracked** - core differentiator |
| Week 8 | Week 7 | Billing | **Fast-tracked** - revenue dependency |
| Week 5 | Week 8 | Review System | Lower priority, moved after billing |
| Week 6 | Week 9 | Timeline | Moved after review system |
| - | Week 10 | Analytics | Split from Week 7 (more time needed)
| Week 8 | Week 11 | Testing | More time for comprehensive tests |

### Priorities

**Fast-Tracked (Higher Priority)**:
- ✅ AI Integration (Week 7 → Week 6) - Core differentiator
- ✅ Billing (Week 8 → Week 7) - Revenue stream

**Delayed (Lower Priority)**:
- Review System (Week 5 → Week 8) - Nice-to-have, not critical for MVP
