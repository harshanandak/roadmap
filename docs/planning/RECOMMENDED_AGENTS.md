## 🎯 Agent Selection Tips

1. **Start with specialized agents** - Use specific agents like `payment-integration` for Razorpay, `security-engineer` for auth
2. **Fall back to general agents** - Use `frontend-developer` if no specialized agent exists
3. **Combine agents** - Launch multiple agents in parallel for complex tasks
4. **Use `code-reviewer` proactively** - Review code after each major feature
5. **Security first** - Always use `security-engineer` for auth, payments, and external-facing features
6. **Type safety throughout** - Use `typescript-pro` beyond just setup (Weeks 1-2, 3, 4, 7, 8)
7. **Test early and often** - Start TDD in Week 4, not just Week 8
8. **API consistency** - Use `api-architect` for all API route design (Weeks 4, 7, 8)
9. **DevOps from day one** - Set up CI/CD in Week 1, not just at launch
