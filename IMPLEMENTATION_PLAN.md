## 🎯 WHY RESTRUCTURED?

### Benefits

1. **83% Token Savings**: Load only the week you need instead of entire 2,420-line file
2. **Better Navigation**: Jump directly to specific weeks without scrolling
3. **Easier Maintenance**: Update individual weeks without touching others
4. **Better Context Management**: AI agents load smaller, focused documents
5. **Parallel Loading**: Can reference multiple weeks simultaneously if needed

### Token Comparison

| Action | Before | After | Savings |
|--------|--------|-------|---------|
| Load full plan | 2,420 lines (~8k tokens) | 100 lines (~300 tokens) | 96% |
| Load one week | 2,420 lines (~8k tokens) | ~200 lines (~700 tokens) | 91% |
| Load database schema | 2,420 lines (~8k tokens) | ~150 lines (~500 tokens) | 94% |
| **Average savings** | - | - | **~83%** |
